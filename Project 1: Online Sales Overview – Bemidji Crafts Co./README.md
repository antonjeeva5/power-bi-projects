  ## Project 1: Online Sales Overview – Bemidji Crafts Co.
    This dynamic Power BI dashboard was developed to analyze and visualize online sales data for a local artisan shop. 
    The goal is to provide actionable insights into sales performance, product popularity, and customer behavior.

## Key Features & Insights:

       * Executive Summary: At-a-glance KPIs track overall performance, including Total Sales ($15.2K), Number of Transactions (200), and Average Order Value ($75.93).

       * Sales Trend Analysis: A month-over-month comparison visualizes sales performance against the previous month, helping to identify seasonality and growth trends.

       * Product Performance: Bar charts break down sales by category and individual product name, clearly highlighting best-selling items like "Woodcraft" and specific products such as the "Hand-Carved Loon Figurine."

       * Customer Insights: A geographic map visualizes sales by customer location, revealing key markets in Minnesota and surrounding areas.

       * Interactive Filtering: The dashboard is fully interactive, allowing users to filter the data by year, month, product category, and customer location for deeper analysis.
