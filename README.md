  #### Problem Statement
  The primary goal was to create a dynamic dashboard for leadership to monitor sales and profitability. Key questions to answer included:
  - What are the top-selling products and regions?
  - How does profit margin change over time?
  - Are we meeting monthly sales targets?

  #### Data Transformation (Power Query)
  - Connected to a CSV file containing raw sales data.
  - Removed duplicate rows and handled missing values in the `Region` column.
  - Created a new conditional column for 'Profit Margin Category' (Low, Medium, High).
  - Unpivoted columns to transform the data from a wide to a long format for better analysis.

  #### Key DAX Measures
  - **Total Sales (YTD):** `Sales YTD = TOTALYTD(SUM(Sales[Revenue]), 'Date'[Date])`
  - **Profit Margin %:** `Profit Margin % = DIVIDE(SUM(Sales[Profit]), SUM(Sales[Revenue]))`

  #### Insights & Recommendations
  1.  **Insight:** The 'Technology' category has the highest revenue but the lowest profit margin (12%).
      - **Recommendation:** Review pricing for high-cost tech items to improve profitability.
  2.  **Insight:** The West region consistently underperforms in Q4 compared to other regions.
       - **Recommendation:** Launch a targeted marketing campaign in the West region in Q3 to boost holiday sales.
